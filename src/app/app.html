      2. Main Content Area (MUST have flex-grow to occupy all remaining space)
      - flex-grow: Tells this element to take up all available vertical space between the banner and the footer.
      - w-full: Ensures it spans the full width.

    <!-- 3. Footer (Stays at the bottom, pushed there by the main element's flex-grow) -->
