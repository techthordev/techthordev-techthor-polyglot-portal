        Hi, I’m Thorsten Fey — an IT professional with strong experience in technical support,
        troubleshooting, and working with complex systems in international environments.
      </p>

      <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
        For many years, I’ve worked across Linux and Windows ecosystems, helping users, solving
        complex issues, and keeping systems running smoothly.

      </p>

      <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
        Alongside my IT career, I’m actively transitioning into software development through a
        structured, hands-on, self-taught journey. My current learning focus includes Java/Spring
        Boot, Angular/TypeScript, Rust, PostgreSQL, and Linux/Fedora.

      </p>

      <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
        I follow clean code principles, build practical projects, and share my progress through
        TechThorDev. But this platform isn’t only about documenting my path — it’s here to help
        others who want to start, restart, or grow in tech.

      </p>

      <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
        Everything I learn, I break down clearly so that beginners and career-changers can benefit
        from it too.
      </p>

      <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
        I bring a structured mindset, analytical thinking, and the motivation to improve every day.
        My international experience helps me collaborate in diverse teams and adapt quickly to new
        tools and technologies. <i class="fas fa-globe-americas text-yellow-600 ml-1"></i>
      </p>

      <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
        Right now, I’m strengthening my portfolio and moving toward development-focused roles, where
        I can combine my IT support background with a growing foundation in backend development and
        system understanding.
      </p>

      <p class="text-xl font-semibold text-blue-700 mt-6">
        Step by step, steady progress — that’s the mission.
